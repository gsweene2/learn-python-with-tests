# Learn Python with Tests!

Welcome to Learn Python with Tests. Our goal is to develop a mastery of Python through test driven development.

Each example will have a `method` or `concept`, `input`, and `output` and use Python utilities and Data Structures.

# Example

## Functions: `len`

### Method/Concept

| Method/Concept | Input | Output |
| - | - |
| [len](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) | `some string` | `11` |

### Test & Method

{% include "./helpers/CODE_BLOCK.md" %}
{% include "./functions/code/test_len.py" %}
{% include "./helpers/CODE_BLOCK.md" %}
